# Energy Consumption Forecasting 

## Introduction

In this project, we tackled the challenge of energy consumption forecasting using machine learning techniques, specifically XGBoost and LightGBM. Energy consumption forecasting is crucial for effective resource management and decision-making in various industries. By accurately predicting energy consumption patterns, organizations can optimize their operations, reduce costs, and ensure efficient utilization of resources.

## Approach and Thought Process

### Understanding the Problem:

Before diving into model building, it's essential to have a clear understanding of the problem at hand. We analyzed historical energy consumption data to identify trends, patterns, and seasonality. Understanding the characteristics of the data is crucial for selecting appropriate modeling techniques and features.

### Selecting Models:

Given the nature of the problem (time series forecasting), we opted for gradient boosting models such as XGBoost and LightGBM. These models are well-suited for handling time series data and are known for their performance and efficiency.

### Feature Engineering:

Feature engineering is a critical step in building effective machine learning models. We engineered lag features to capture temporal dependencies in the data. Lag features allow the model to consider past observations when making predictions, which is crucial for accurate forecasting.

### Model Training and Evaluation:

We split the data into training and validation sets to train and evaluate our models. During training, we fine-tuned model hyperparameters to optimize performance. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were used to assess model accuracy and identify areas for improvement.

### Interpretation and Insights:

Once the models were trained and evaluated, we analyzed the results to gain insights into energy consumption patterns. Understanding the factors influencing energy consumption can provide valuable insights for decision-making and resource allocation.

## Conclusion

By leveraging machine learning techniques such as XGBoost and LightGBM, we successfully developed models for energy consumption forecasting. This project demonstrates the power of data-driven approaches in addressing real-world challenges and highlights the importance of accurate forecasting for effective resource management and decision-making.
